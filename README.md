# VidlyBackend

This is the backend of a small movie application. It connects to an MongoDB database using CRUD and has a REST API to handle incoming requests.
The main purpose of this project is to test a front-end movie service I'm building in React.

As I progress with my React application, I will be increasing the features of this application as well to compliment it. There are tons of things that still need implementing!

## ToDo
- JWT authentication
- User handling
- Login handling
- Docker containerization
- HTTPS certificate
- Learning envoy?
